This is my individual part of Software Project Management (SPM) module - SE3080 group project ( 3rd Year 2nd Semester ), where you have to build a timetable generating system. We have used java and swing for the implementation and Apache derby as the database where the final product is a .exe executable file which can be installed in any device.

My contribution to the project was:

- Add, update, delete working days and hours 🕔
- Generate lecturer timetable, student timetable, particular room timetable 
- Print timetables
